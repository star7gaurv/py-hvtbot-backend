# ü§ñ Crypto Volume Trading Bot - How It Works

## üìã Overview

The **py-hvtbot-backend** is an automated cryptocurrency trading bot designed to generate trading volume on the LBank exchange. It operates by coordinating trades between two separate accounts to create market activity.

---

## üéØ What Does This Bot Do?

The bot automatically executes cryptocurrency trades between two accounts to:

- **Generate Trading Volume**: Creates consistent market activity
- **Maintain Market Presence**: Keeps the trading pair active with regular transactions
- **Simulate Natural Trading**: Uses randomization to mimic human trading patterns
- **Balance Management**: Automatically manages funds between accounts

---

## üîÑ The Two-Account System

### Why Two Accounts?

The bot requires **two separate LBank exchange accounts** to function:

- **Account 1**: Acts as the seller in some trades, buyer in others
- **Account 2**: Acts as the buyer in some trades, seller in others

Both accounts need:
- ‚úÖ API keys configured
- ‚úÖ Sufficient balance (both USDT and the trading token)
- ‚úÖ Trading permissions enabled

### How They Work Together

The accounts work in a **ping-pong pattern**:

```
Round 1: Account 1 Sells ‚Üí Account 2 Buys
Round 2: Account 2 Sells ‚Üí Account 1 Buys
Round 3: Account 1 Sells ‚Üí Account 2 Buys
... and so on
```

This creates a back-and-forth trading flow that generates volume.

## üí° Trading Strategy Explained

### 1. **Price Selection**

The bot doesn't just pick random prices. It works intelligently:

- **Reads the Order Book**: Gets current bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices
- **Calculates Mid-Price**: Finds a price between bid and ask
- **Adds Randomization**: Slightly varies the price to look natural
- **Respects Spread Limits**: Only trades when spread is within your configured range

**Example:**
```
Current Bid: $0.0100
Current Ask: $0.0105
Bot Selects: $0.01023 (random between bid and ask)
```

### 2. **Order Splitting**

To appear more human-like, the bot splits large orders into smaller chunks:

**Instead of:**
```
One order: 10,000 HVT at $0.0102
```

**It does:**
```
Order 1: 2,500 HVT at $0.01020
Wait 30 seconds...
Order 2: 4,000 HVT at $0.01024
Wait 45 seconds...
Order 3: 3,500 HVT at $0.01019
```

This makes the trading activity look organic and natural.

### 3. **Timing Randomization**

The bot doesn't trade at fixed intervals. Instead:

- You set a **minimum** and **maximum** wait time (e.g., 30-300 seconds)
- The bot randomly picks a time in that range
- Each trade happens at unpredictable intervals
- This mimics real human trading behavior

---

## üéõÔ∏è Configurable Parameters

You have full control over how the bot operates:

### **Time Settings**
- **Min Time**: Shortest wait between trades (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Max Time**: Longest wait between trades (e.g., 5 minutes)

### **Volume Settings**
- **Wallet Percentage**: How much of your balance to use per trade (e.g., 5%)
- **Pause Volume**: Stop trading if daily volume exceeds this limit (safety feature)

### **Price Settings**
- **Min Spread**: Minimum acceptable spread to trade (e.g., 0.01%)
- **Max Spread**: Maximum acceptable spread to trade (e.g., 10%)

### **Trading Behavior**
- **Buy/Sell Ratio**: Controls whether orders appear more as "buys" or "sells" in the order book
- **Trading Pair**: Which cryptocurrency to trade (e.g., HVT/USDT)

---

## üîç Step-by-Step: A Single Trading Cycle

Let's walk through exactly what happens when the bot executes one trade cycle:

### **Step 1: Check Daily Volume**
```
‚úì Check: Has today's volume reached the pause limit?
  ‚Üí If YES: Skip trading and wait
  ‚Üí If NO: Continue to Step 2
```

### **Step 2: Get Market Data**
```
‚úì Fetch current order book
‚úì Get bid price: $0.0100
‚úì Get ask price: $0.0105
‚úì Calculate spread: 5%
```

### **Step 3: Verify Spread is Acceptable**
```
‚úì Check: Is 5% spread within min (0.01%) and max (10%)?
  ‚Üí If YES: Continue
  ‚Üí If NO: Use backup strategy or wait
```

### **Step 4: Check Account Balances**
```
Account 1:
  - USDT: $1,000
  - HVT: 50,000 tokens

Account 2:
  - USDT: $1,200
  - HVT: 45,000 tokens

‚úì Both accounts have sufficient balance
```

### **Step 5: Calculate Trade Amount**
```
‚úì Wallet percentage: 5%
‚úì Account 1 has 50,000 HVT
‚úì Trade amount: 50,000 √ó 5% = 2,500 HVT
```

### **Step 6: Split the Order**
```
‚úì Randomly split 2,500 HVT into chunks:
  - 800 HVT
  - 1,100 HVT
  - 600 HVT
```

### **Step 7: Execute Trades**
```
Trade 1:
  Account 1: SELL 800 HVT at $0.01023
  Account 2: BUY 800 HVT at $0.01023
  Wait 47 seconds...

Trade 2:
  Account 1: SELL 1,100 HVT at $0.01019
  Account 2: BUY 1,100 HVT at $0.01019
  Wait 62 seconds...

Trade 3:
  Account 1: SELL 600 HVT at $0.01021
  Account 2: BUY 600 HVT at $0.01021
```

### **Step 8: Wait and Repeat**
```
‚úì Wait random time (between min and max)
‚úì Next cycle starts with Account 2 selling to Account 1
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

The bot includes several protective mechanisms:

### **1. Volume Pause**
```
If daily volume > pause limit:
  ‚Üí Stop all trading
  ‚Üí Resume next day
```
**Why?** Prevents excessive volume that might look suspicious.

### **2. Balance Verification**
```
Before each trade:
  ‚Üí Check if accounts have enough USDT
  ‚Üí Check if accounts have enough tokens
  ‚Üí If insufficient: Skip trade and alert
```
**Why?** Prevents failed orders and errors.

### **3. Spread Monitoring**
```
If spread is too wide or too narrow:
  ‚Üí Use backup trading strategy
  ‚Üí Or wait for better conditions
```
**Why?** Ensures trades happen at reasonable prices.

### **4. Order Book Analysis**
```
Continuously monitors:
  ‚Üí Current bid/ask prices
  ‚Üí Market depth
  ‚Üí Recent price movements
```
**Why?** Makes intelligent trading decisions.

## üé® Special Trading Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Normal Spread Trading**
When there's a good spread between bid and ask:
- Place orders at various mid-prices
- Create natural-looking volume
- Alternate between accounts

### **Strategy 2: No-Gap Trading**
When bid and ask prices are too close:
- Use minimum transaction amounts
- Trade at existing prices (market taking)
- Create new price levels slightly outside current range

### **Strategy 3: Order Appearance Control**
Based on your buy/sell ratio setting:
- Some trades appear as "buy orders" in the market
- Some trades appear as "sell orders" in the market
- This creates realistic market depth on both sides

---

## üìä What Happens to Your Funds?

### **The Net Effect**

After a complete trading cycle (forward + backward):

**Account 1:**
```
Before: 1,000 USDT + 50,000 HVT
After:  ~1,000 USDT + ~50,000 HVT (roughly the same)
```

**Account 2:**
```
Before: 1,200 USDT + 45,000 HVT
After:  ~1,200 USDT + ~45,000 HVT (roughly the same)
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Tokens move back and forth between accounts

## üí¨ Common Questions

**Q: Will I lose money?**
A: The bot trades at mid-prices, so theoretically you break even. However, exchange fees mean small losses over time.

**Q: How much volume can it generate?**
A: Depends on your wallet percentage and timing settings. Typically $10,000 - $100,000+ per day.

**Q: Can I run it 24/7?**
A: Yes, but use the volume pause feature to prevent excessive activity.

**Q: What if one account runs out of funds?**
A: The bot detects this and pauses trading until you add more funds.

**Q: Does it affect the actual token price?**
A: Since trades happen between your own accounts at mid-prices, it has minimal price impact.
